# House Price Prediction in Python - Full Machine Learning Project

This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project aimed at predicting house prices using Python. It covers the entire data science process, from data exploration to model evaluation.

## Overview

In this project, we explore a dataset containing various features related to housing, such as median income, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, and ocean proximity. The goal is to predict the median house value based on these features.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset file(s).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- `src/`: Source code for any scripts or modules used in the project.
- `requirements.txt`: File listing the required Python libraries and their versions.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
